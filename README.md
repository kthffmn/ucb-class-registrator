# UCB Sketch 301

## About

This app is in two parts: a small Ruby app and a JavaScript extention.

## Ruby App

This app follows the Twitter account for [@UCBClasses](https://twitter.com/UCBClassesNYC).

If @UCBClasses tweets about a Sketch 301 class, the app opens the link to the class' show page in the browser. 
## JavaScript App

This script double checks for whether a page in the browser is a show page for a Sketch 301 class at UCB's New York Training Center.

If it is a Sketch 301 class, it then clicks "Register" on the first page, "Agree" on the policy page, fills in the form on the register page with the user's info, then clicks "Continue Registration".
